Code that creates visualizations and analyses of HLM results to draw conclusions for the manuscript. All figure outputs go to the `Figures` folder. All code using maps draws on http://github.com/jebyrnes/meowR

###### `00_sample_size_yr.R`
Simple code to plot number of sampling points by year and output histograms of study durations.

###### `01_Modelanddata_plots.R`

Plots the timeseries of studies within each region along with modeled curves - both for the indivudal sites and for the region at large - overlain.

###### `02_regional_probability_maps.R`

Plots the Baysian posterior probability of individual ecoregions having a non-zero temporal trend.

###### `03_slope_maps.R`
Plots the estimated slopes of temporal trends in ecoregions as well as information on their posterior probability of having a non-zero trend.

###### `04_means_plots.R`
Generates plots of the distribution of temporal trend coefficients with summary information about their group mean estimates and variation in those estimates.

###### `05_leaflet_plot_slopes.R`

Creates an interactive clickable map of all studies showing the trend via a blue-red color scale. Points can be clicked on for more information about trends.

###### `06_slope_by_study_duration.R`

Plots of the relationship between temporal trends within sites and how long the site was sampled.
