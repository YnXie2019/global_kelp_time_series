## Introduction 

This folder contains all of the code required to run the hierarchical linear model analyses in R and return basic figures. The core file is the "02_HLM_Analysis.R" file but loads other files in the folder.   Thus one will need to have other files referenced in the working directory specified.  

## Requirements

These analyses require the following dependencies: 

For R: 
rstan,plyr,gdata,ggplot2,parallel,grid,coda,reshape2,dplyr

Other software:
Stan - for installation see https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

## Contact

Analytical code was primarily written by D.K. Okamoto. Inquiries can be addressed to dokamoto@sfu.ca.
